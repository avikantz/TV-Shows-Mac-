TV Shows Listing app for Mac OS X.

This app lists your personal collection of TV series.

The list generator (⌘G) works by adding information about files and folders contained in the root TV Series folder. Shows arranged as: Root/'ShowName'/'SeasonName or Episodes'/'EpisodeFiles in Season'

Alternatively adding a show manually is done in format:<br>
Name: Show Title<br>
Detail: 'SeasonCount' Season(s), 'EpisodeCount' Episode(s) ('Size' MB/GB)

Tags in Detail string:
"CURRENTLY_FOLLOWING" green tag for following series<br>
"TO_BE_DOWNLOADED" blue tag for the series to be downloaded<br>
"TO_BE_ENCODED" orange tag for the series to be encoded<br>

Different sort orders accessed by ⌘1 to ⌘9.

Rearranging only works in rank wise sort.

Images are saved (press 'fn' in detail view) if the API returns a show name matching the folder name.

Data files are located in ~Library/Application Support/Listing (Mac).
